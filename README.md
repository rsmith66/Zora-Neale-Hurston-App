# Zora Neale Hurston App

This app was created to serve as my Final Project for the class KHC HC 501: People and Places which focused on the author Zora Neale Hurston. The only constraint on this project was to make something you can be proud of, so I decided to make this app.

## Bio Page

When the user clicks start, the Biography page is the first page that appears. This page serves as a guide to explain who Zora Neale Hurston is, her background, and why she is a significant figure in history.

## Timeline Page

The Timeline Page was created by splitting the page into two columns— one with circular icons and lines connecting them and then the other with the event cards with text inside. This page helped me become much more familiar with the Flutter framework and its UI design tools.

## Selected Works page

I wanted a way for a user to interact with her texts and learn more about them individually, so I added this page that allows the user to click on various selected work and get a description of the work and the date it was published. 

## Quiz Page

This was the page I focused the most on as I felt like having some kind of truly interactive element to the app was important as it took advantage of the main draw of mobile apps. Each quiz leads to an instructions page and then to the actual questions which are chosen randomly and ensured to not duplicate. After the user enters a response and clicks “Submit,” the user’s response is sent to the multiple choice page of the quiz where the response is checked against multiple variations of the correct response and either substituted for the correct response or added to the wrong options written. The location of each option is randomized, so if you were to see a question multiple times over multiple play throughs, the options would be in a different order. After choosing an option, the page highlights the correct response, displays the result of the user’s choice above, and turns the chosen option red if that selection was wrong. Lastly, after 5 questions, the user is sent to a page that displays the final results, giving the user a unique response based off their performance and the options to Play again with new, randomized questions or to go back to the main quiz page to select a different category.
